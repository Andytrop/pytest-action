# Run pytest

This GitHub Action allows you to run pytest and output [GitHub Job Summaries](https://github.blog/2022-05-09-supercharging-github-actions-with-job-summaries/). For creating the job summaries, this action uses [pytest-md](https://github.com/hackebrot/pytest-md) and [pytest-emoji](https://github.com/hackebrot/pytest-emoji).
